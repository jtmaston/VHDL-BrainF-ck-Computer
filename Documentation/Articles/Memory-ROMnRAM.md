# Reading and writing from memory

## Architecture

The distinction between ROM and RAM is that of writeability. ROM memory is supposed to only be programmed at the factory
(i.e. at flash time), and retains its value, while RAM is volatile, designed to be reprogrammable and writen to multiple
times.
